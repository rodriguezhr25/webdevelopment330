        <h1>Notes</h1>

        <h2>Master Mobile UX</h2>

        <p>Designing mobile-first provides better opportunities to create an excellent product using less time and resources, adapted to the actual market.
        </p>
        <p> Be there. Be useful. Be quick. We need to understand what the users need from an application, may be participating in their process, getting involved with them. Make interactions with users simple, improvement means fewer steps. User experience
            is related to how somebody feels interacting with some app. </p>
        <p>
            Speed Matters. Access to an app must be simple, reducing images, using SVG, optimize the file size. Also, consider that not everybody has a high-speed connection.
        </p>
        <p> Placement matters. Place the controls in the best area to access. (In mobile at the bottom like Facebook app in iPhone) Simplifying forms allow users to interact with the app in a friendly way, asking for the necessary information. </p>

        </p>Present the appropriate keyboard to users, showing numbers when is required without additional clicks. </p>
        <h2>Think, design, test, and create.</h2>
        <p>
             The creation of software involves several activities that are crucial to obtaining good results. First, we need to think, visualize what we need and how we will process it, which is known as the design. Then we need to
            decide about the standards of the final product, using testing methods. Finally, we can begin tho build the app because when the precedent steps are omitted, the development could turn into a complete disaster. One of the first functions of
            every web application is to catch information from users to process and give them an output. We can achieve this by creating forms, with inputs, buttons, Javascript functions, and applying some CSS. Javascript is a powerful tool to manage
            numbers and make computations from inputs taken in the view or HTML.
        </p>
        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>How can we apply Javascript to create simple solutions for web apps?</li>
            <li>Which is the best way to apply agile frameworks in software development?</li>
            <li>JSON can be used to generate local files to populate date without internet connection?</li>
        </ol>
